            <p>The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and
                often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.
                The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.
                Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                sharp
                teeth and
                retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk
                (crepuscular).</p>
            <p>Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and
                other
                small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and
                have a
                better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social
                species.
                Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling
                and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.[7]</p>
